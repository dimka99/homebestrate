"Understanding Your Budget: How Much House Can You REALLY Afford?"

Most people focus only on the sale price, but you need to consider:

🏠 Monthly Payment Breakdown:
• Principal & Interest
• Property Taxes (1-2% of home value annually)
• Home Insurance ($800-$2,000 annually)
• PMI (if down payment <20%)
• HOA Fees (if applicable)

📝 Quick Affordability Formula:
Your total monthly housing costs should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income.

🎉 SUCCESS STORY: From Renter to Homeowner!

Meet Jessica, 28, who thought home ownership was years away...

🏠 HER JOURNEY:
• Started with a 640 credit score
• Only had 5% saved for down payment
• Was paying $1,800/month in rent
• Felt overwhelmed by the process

🚀 HOW WE HELPED:
1. Credit improvement plan (raised to 720 in 4 months)
2. Found down payment assistance programs
3. Compared 15 lenders to find best rate
4. Secured 6.125% on 30-year fixed

📈 THE RESULT:
• Monthly payment: $1,950 (only $150 more than rent!)
• Closed in 45 days
• Now building equity instead of paying rent

"Mortgage Rate Hub made what seemed impossible actually happen! The rate comparison alone saved me $200/month." - Jessica
